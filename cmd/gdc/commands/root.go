	Long: `
         global_docker_compose can be used to centralize and standardize Docker dependencies used within Flipp.
         The idea is to have one tool that can spin up whatever services are needed and keep that tool updated
         with fixes and improvements, rather than having a separate docker-compose.yml file in every project.
         The project can have a shell script (denoted "gdc") which calls this tool with the services it needs
         for itself.
